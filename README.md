# Poem_Generator
Have you ever been stuck with an assignment to write a poem? Struggling to woo a romantic interest? Or do you just want to test your creative skills against a  computer?

This program uses a Markov Chain branch to generate a unique poem inspired by three famous authors. The user is prompted to set the number of words and select three of the five possible sources of inspiration.

Run the 'run.py' file in python to start the process.
